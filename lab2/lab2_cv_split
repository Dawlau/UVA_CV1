2 - 2 neighbourhood processing (theoretical questions no coding)
3: 3.1 gaussian filters
   3.2 gabor filters (more code than gaussian)
4: 4.1 noise in digital images (theoretical questions)
   4.2 image denoising (theory + code)
   4.3 edge detection (theory + code)
   4.4 foreground-background separation (theory + code)
   
   
 My split:
 
 1) 2, 3.2 4.2
 2) 3.1, 4.1, 4.3
 3) 4.4
